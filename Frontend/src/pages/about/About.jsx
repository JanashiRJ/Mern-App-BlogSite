      <span className="para1">Flowers & Seasons are intimately bound to each other.
      Most of the flowers are season - specific. Though some flowers are found throughout the year, 
      there are some not particularly affected by changing seasons, viz.,
      Alstromeria, Anthurium, Aster, Bourvardia, Carnation, Chrysanthemum, Gerbera Daisy, 
      Lily, Asiatic Lily.The various climatic changes that occur in cyclic patterns are termed as 'seasons'. 
      There are four general seasons occurring on Earth - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.</span>

      <span className="para2">Spring Time the time of growth and renewal of new plant and animal life. 
      Spring comes at different times in the North and South Hemispheres.
      Spring time in the Northern hemisphere is between March - May, and between September - 
      November in the Southern hemisphere. Most flowering plants bloom during spring time.
       Therefore, flowers that bloom only during spring, Spring Flowers, bloom at different times in the two hemispheres.
